# ProjectNarration

A fun personal project about trying to make a somewhat working sentence generator with very limited resources, mainly using the idea of Markov Chains.

This project is very rudimentary, as I obviously have yet to possess actual machine learning knowledge, and was merely trying to do something similar.

This repository contains a Python file of the full program as well as a Jupyter notebook detailing the thoughts behind said program.

Check it out and I hope you find it interesting.

Quick Bullet Point Summary by ChatGPT:
-The document discusses a simple sentence generator program and its functioning.
-The program picks words based on random chance, influenced by word frequencies.
-It divides sentences into individual words and uses Markov matrices for analysis.
-The program's outputs are basic and nonsensical but resemble human speech patterns.
-While limited, the program serves as an educational example for beginners in AI.
